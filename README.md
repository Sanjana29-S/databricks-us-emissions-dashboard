# U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dashboard (Databricks)

## Overview
This project analyzes **U.S. greenhouse gas emissions** using publicly available EPA data and presents insights through an **interactive Databricks dashboard**. The analysis focuses on state- and county-level emissions patterns, per-capita emissions, and population relationships to support data-driven environmental insights.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate hands-on experience with **cloud-based analytics**, **SQL-driven data modeling**, and **data storytelling** using Databricks.

## Business Problem
Greenhouse gas emissions data is widely available but often difficult to analyze at scale or visualize in a way that supports decision-making.

This project addresses:
- Identifying **high-impact emission contributors**
- Understanding **per-capita emission trends**
- Exploring **geographic concentration of emissions**
- Enabling stakeholders to prioritize **policy and resource allocation**

---

## Key Insights
- **~51% of total U.S. emissions originate from just 10 states**
- States with larger populations tend to have **lower per-capita CO₂ emissions**
- Emissions show strong **geographic clustering** at the county level
- A small subset of regions contributes disproportionately to national emissions

---

## Dashboard Features
- **Geospatial Map**: County-level emissions across the continental U.S.
- **Scatter Analysis**: Population vs per-capita emissions
- **Top Contributors**: Top 10 states by total emissions
- **County Rankings**: Highest-emitting counties by CO₂e

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

- **Source:** EPA Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data
- **Year:** 2023
- **Granularity:** County and State level
- **Usage:** Publicly available data used for educational and analytical purposes

The data was accessed and queried within Databricks and is not stored directly in this repository.
